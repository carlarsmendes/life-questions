        <p>"Most of us think about love as something that happens to us. We fall. We get crushed. But love is an action."
        </p>
    
        <p>There are lots of ways to celebrate upcoming Valentine's Day. This year, consider doing something different. If
            you're not in a relationship, propose doing this experiment with someone you've always thought was interesting
            but have yet to take the leap with. What do you have to lose?</p>
    
        <p>And if you're in a relationship, skip the fancy dinner or other high-pressure, conventional thing.
    
            Instead, grab a bottle of wine and make the choice to commit to the magic of the questions. Allow the
            vulnerability of the answers to carry you even closer together. Take on the challenge of revealing yourself even
            more deeply to the person you cherish most in the world, and revel in the soul-deep connection that can ensue.
        </p>
    
        <p>Take action.</p>
    
        <p>Fall in love - Or deeper into it.</p>
