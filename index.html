        <p>"Most of us think about connection as something that happens to us. We fall in love. We get crushed.</p>
        <p>  But love and connection - These are actions."
        </p>
        <br>
    
        <p> If you're not in a relationship, propose doing this experiment with someone you've always thought was interesting
            but have yet to take the leap with. What do you have to lose?</p>
    
        <p>And if you're in a relationship, skip the fancy dinner. </p>
        <br>
        <p> Instead, grab a bottle of wine and make the choice to commit to the magic of the questions. Allow the
            vulnerability of the answers to carry you closer together. Take on the challenge of revealing yourself even
            more deeply to someone else, and revel in the soul-deep connection that can ensue.
        </p>
    <br>
        <p>Take action.</p>
    <br>
        <p>Fall in love - Or deeper into it.</p>
